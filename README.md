*Project under development*

This project is an exercise in creating, querying, and manipulating database information, with a simple game-like format. It will create a unique star cluster, which the user will then be able to explore. The user will have the god-like abilities to explode stars (destroying any planets in the system) as well as to create a new star from the resulting molecular cloud. Each star will be unique with characteristics of age, mass, luminosity, planets, and a location in the 3D cluster. Planets will be created with characteristics of mass, basic composition, and distance from the home star. This project will include some astronomical formulas and units, though I am not an expert in astrophysics (nor is it the focus of the project). 

- au (Astronomical Unit) = 149,597,870,700 meters or 92,955,807 miles
- ly (Light Year) = 63,241.1au
- M = Solar Mass (1M = mass of our Sun)
- L = Solar Luminosity (1L = luminosity of our Sun)

Built with Python 3.6 and SQLite3
