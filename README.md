Star Explorer's database infrastructure is fully functional. The game-like shell wrapping this functionality will be constructed over time.

*Project under development*

This project is an exercise in creating, querying, and manipulating database information, with a simple game-like format. It will create a unique star cluster, which the user will then be able to explore. The user will have the god-like abilities to explode stars (destroying any planets in the system) as well as to create a new star from the resulting nebula. Each star will be unique with characteristics of age, mass, planets, and a 3D location in the cluster. Planets will be created with characteristics of mass, basic composition, potential habitability, and distance from the home star. 

Note: This project will include some astronomical concepts and units. I am by no means an expert in astrophysics, nor is it the purpose of the project to be a realistic astronomical model.

- au (Astronomical Unit) = 1au is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun; 149,597,870,700 meters or 92,955,807 miles
- ly (Light Year) = 63,241.1au
- Solar Mass: Our Sun is 1 Solar Mass
- Earth Mass: Earth is 1 Earth Mass

Built with Python 3.6 and SQLite3
